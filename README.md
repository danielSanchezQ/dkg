# Implementation of a distributed key generation algorithm for DL cryptosystems
This implementation is a slight variation of [Gennaro et al.'s paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00145-006-0347-3.pdf).

DISCLAIMER: This repo is in active development,  experimental, with the goal of creating a 
elliptic curve agnostinc DKG implementation, and should not be used.
